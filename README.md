Hi, I'm Abel Juncal, and I'm interested in computer science, particularly in AI. I'm currently studying the Master in Artificial Intelligence at Universidade da Coru√±a, but I'm always striving to learn new skills beyond the university curriculum. Since my childhood, I've been tinkering with computers at home, repairing them when necessary, and using them to learn new things. Right now, my main focus is on completing my master degree and expanding my knowledge base in computing.
