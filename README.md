  Hi, I'm Abel Juncal, a 20 years old guy interesed in computer science and specially in AI. I'm currently at fourth year of the computer science at Universidade da Coru√±a, but i
  always attemp to learn new skills far from university. Since my childhood, i've been messing around computers in my house, repairing then when it was necesary and using them to 
  learn a lot of things about hardware and software. At this moment, I'm focused on finishing my degree and grow as a source of knowledge about 
  computing.
